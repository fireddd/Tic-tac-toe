# Tic-tac-toe
The aim of the Project is to implement the develop a Tic-Tac-toe playing bot. 

There are two functional bots:

1)The bot plays for the it's win else blocks the opponent's win.If both the above are not possible then it goes for the center square.
If the square it taken, then it goes for one of the corners available. If all of the above is not possible then it randoms choses among
the middle squares of the sides. The following bot plays resaonably well and hasn't been beaten yet. 

2)The bot uses the MinMax Algorithm to play the optimal tic-tac-toe that is the bot never loses.
