# Tic-tac-toe
The aim of the Project is to implement the develop a Tic-Tac-toe playing bot. 

There are two functional bots:

1)The bot plays for the it's win else blocks the opponent's win.If both the above are not possible then it goes for the center square.
If the square it taken, then it goes for one of the corners available. If all of the above is not possible then it randoms choses among
the middle squares of the sides. The following bot plays resaonably well and hasn't been beaten yet. 

2)The bot uses the MinMax Algorithm to play the optimal tic-tac-toe that is the bot never loses.


#How to Run the bot

It is a simple yet easily navigable Tic-Tac-Toe game for the Unix terminal. To run this file, go
to your Unix terminal and (after you have downloaded this text file, of course) and
navigate to this file. 

Then, compile and link the program with your compiler which will
almost definitely be installed unless you have removed it using the command 'gcc Filename.c' 

Eg:'gcc Minmax.c'.

This creates an executeable. To run it, you can simply type './a.out'.
